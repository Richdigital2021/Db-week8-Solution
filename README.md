# Projects: Clinic Booking System & Contact Book API

## üìò Project 1: Clinic Booking System (MySQL Database)

### üéØ Objective

In this project I design and implement a full-featured relational database for **Clinic Booking System** using only **MySQL**. The database is well structured and contain tables with proper constraints (pk, fk, not null, unique). Relationships (1-1, 1-M, M-M) were also implemented.

### ü©∫ Description

This project simulates a real-world clinic scenario with tables for doctors, patients, appointments, and specializations. It demonstrates relational database modeling with proper constraints and normalization.

### üìê Features

- Proper use of constraints: `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`
- Support for 1-to-Many and Many-to-Many relationships
- Sample data included for testing

### üóÇÔ∏è Database Schema

- `patients`: Stores patient information
- `doctors`: Stores doctor details
- `specializations`: Lists various medical specialties
- `appointments`: Records patient bookings with doctors
- `doctor_specializations`: Many-to-many relation between doctors and their specialties

### üìé Files Included

- `clinic_booking_system.sql`  
  Contains:
  - All `CREATE TABLE` statements
  - `INSERT INTO` statements with sample data
  - `SAMPLE QUERIES` to test the database

## üîß Project 2: Contact Book API (FastAPI + MySQL)

### üéØ Objective

This project is a working CRUD API created using Python and MYSQL. I design the database schema in MySQL and build the API using: FastAPI. I implement all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). And Connected the API to the MySQL database.

Build a **CRUD API** using **FastAPI** that connects to a **MySQL** database to manage contact records.

### üóíÔ∏è Description

This project allows users to manage a contact book through a RESTful API. It supports full CRUD operations, built using Python's FastAPI and SQLAlchemy ORM for database interaction.

### üß± Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy
- **Environment**: Python 3.9+, MySQL Server

### üìê Features

- Create, Read, Update, Delete contacts
- Grouping of contacts (optional)
- Search contacts (by name, email)

### üóÇÔ∏è Database Schema

- `contacts`: Stores basic contact info
- `groups`: Defines groups like "Friends", "Work", etc.
- `contact_group`: Many-to-many table to link contacts with groups
